# EMF_VisualizationAndCalculation_Project2
In this MATLAB project, I determined various magnetic properties of a domain with a conductor at its center, and 2 bars of iron along the sides. The magnetic field around the current-carrying conductor was also analyzed.  See .docx file for greater project details
