# EMF_VisualizationAndCalculation_Project2
Using MATLAB, this project determines various magnetic properties of a domain with a conductor at its center and 2 bars of iron along the sides. The magnetic field around the current-carrying conductor was also visualized in a contour map. See .docx file for full project details
